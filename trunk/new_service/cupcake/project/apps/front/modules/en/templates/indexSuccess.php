	<p>"Each cake is made from scratch and baked fresh every day. We source the highest quality ingredients including free range eggs, creamy butter, vanilla and Valrhona chocolate. Each cake is hand finished and topped with a splash of colour. "Expect adventurous flavours that 
are stylishly presented. The cupcakes are a cheeky indulgence perfect for a little celebratory treat." Says Kim the Malaysian pastry chef who is trained at Le Cordon Bleu Paris and worked in pastry kitchens in Paris, London, Sydney and now Beijing.</p>

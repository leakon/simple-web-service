Q: How long does Colibri cupcake stay fresh?<br />
<strong>A: Because Colibri Cupcakes are baked with all natural ingredients every morning (Preservative-free, Artificial color-free), the best taste will be enjoyed on the day of purchase. However, if you want to keep cupcakes fresh and longer, keep them in the refrigerator. It helps to wrap the box with cling film to limit air flow which may makes cupcake dry.</strong></p>
